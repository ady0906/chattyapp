React Boilerplate
=====================

A minimal and light dev environment for ReactJS.

### Usage

Get the server side from:

```
github.com/ady0906/chattyserver

npm install
npm start
```

Install the dependencies and start the server then, on the boiler repo:

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

npm run lint
```
